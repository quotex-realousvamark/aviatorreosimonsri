### No Gambling or Betting

Quotex is a trading platform that primarily offers binary options and
digital options. These instruments involve predicting price movements of
underlying assets (e.g., currencies, commodities) within a specified

and digital options involve a certain level of skill and analysis.
Traders must make informed decisions based on market trends and
technical indicators.

Quotex does not provide any form of interest-based loans or financing to
its traders. Traders are solely responsible for managing their trading
capital and do not incur any additional financial charges from the
platform.

### No Monopoly in the Market

Quotex operates in a competitive market with numerous other trading
platforms. It does not possess a monopoly or dominant position that
could lead to unfair advantages or market manipulation.

## Conclusion: Is Quotex Halal?

Based on the analysis above, it is generally considered that Quotex
trading is compliant with the principles of Islamic Sharia. Its absence
of gambling, interest-based loans, and monopoly practices align with
halal trading guidelines.
